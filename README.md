## Mission

The mission of this project is to build a home for lived experiences.
The goal is to capture a glimpse of the wisdom and meaning that imbued
an individual’s life on earth. We live in unprecedented times. There
are more people alive now than ever before; more ideas, more emotions,
more stories, and more relationships. The question of the meaning of
life can feel static and impersonal, while our lives are inherently
dynamic and personal. We live, love and learn. The advent of the
internet brings with it the opportunity to document this vast network
of human learning, across culture and continent. We want to create a
platform which gives all people the ability to pass on some of the
wisdom they’ve gained in this lifetime. We believe this fountain of
human learning can serve as a guiding light in these trying times.
Fundamentally, the human condition project is an art piece which seeks
to include as many artists as possible in expressing “what did you
learn in this life.”

## Method

We hope to give as many people as possible the opportunity to share
their legacy. As this page looks back on those before us, we only show
pieces of people who have passed. If someone you love has passed and
wishes to have their experiences expressed, please share with us their
knowledge.
